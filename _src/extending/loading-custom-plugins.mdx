title: Dynamically Loading Plugins

<FbInternalOnly>

<div class="warning">

Inside Facebook, plugins sources are stored and loaded from `~/fbsource/xplat/sonar/desktop/plugins`,
in which case no further configuration is needed.

If your team uses Flipper plugins that are stored outside `fbsource`, please follow your team specific instructions.

Flipper loads and runs plugins it finds in a configurable location. The paths searched are specified in `~/.flipper/config.json`. These paths, `pluginPaths`, should contain one folder for each of the plugins it stores. An example config setting and plugin file structure is shown below:

`~/.flipper/config.json`:
```
{
  ...,
  "pluginPaths": ["~/flipper-plugins"]
}
```
Plugin File example structure:
```
~ flipper-plugins/
    my-plugin/
      package.json
      src/index.tsx
      dist/bundle.js
```

Note: when using `npx flipper-pkg init` for scaffolding, as explained in the [tutorial](../tutorial/intro.mdx) or on the next page, the path should be configured automatically for you in most cases.

Typically, the above setup is only needed if you are developing plugins. 
To consume plugins, it is recommended to use one of the existing [distribution mechanisms](plugin-distribution.mdx) instead.
