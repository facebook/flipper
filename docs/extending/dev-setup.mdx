## IDE

<OssOnly>

When developing Flipper plugins we recommend the following IDEs:

1. TypeScript (for Flipper Desktop (plugins)): Visual Studio Code
    1. Install the "ESLint" (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension from marketplace to enable linting
    1. Install the "Prettier" (esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension to enable automatic code-formatting
    1. If for some reason it is not working, the builtin TypeScript extension might be disabled. To enable it, to go to extensions, search for “@builtin typescript” and enable it.

1. Android Studio (for Android plugins)
1. XCode (for iOS plugins)

</OssOnly>

### TypeScript

Flipper Desktop is written in TypeScript. 
Using our internal "VSCode @ FB" as IDE is strongly recommended (`code-fb`).

Make sure to install the `[FB-Internal]` "ESLint" and "Pretter" extensions are enabled.

If for some reason it is not working, the builtin TypeScript extension might be disabled. To enable it, to go to extensions, search for “@builtin typescript” and enable it.

### Android (Java)

IntelliJ is the recommended platform. Focussing on a flipper-enabled app should include the flipper modules as expected.

If you don't have an fbsource checkout (e.g. Whatsapp Team), you can open Android Studio and import project: `fbsource/xplat/sonar`

If you're having gradle (or other) problems, make sure you're on the latest Android Studio version.

## Running Flipper from source (recommended)

When developing Flipper plugins we strongly recommend to run from Flipper itself from source as well, as this yields several benefits:


- Automatic transpilation and bundling of loaded plugins: ES6, TypeScript, JSX.
- Automatic refresh after code changes.
- React and Redux Dev Tools.
- [Debugging](debugging) using Chrome Dev Tools or Visual Studio Code.
- Additional debug information like React warnings and performance metrics. 

Prerequisites for Flipper development build:
- node ≥ 14
- yarn ≥ 1.5
- git
- watchman

To run Flipper Desktop from source:

<OssOnly>

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/flipper.git
cd flipper/desktop
yarn
yarn start
```

Tip: start with `yarn start --fast-refresh` for experimental fast refresh.

</OssOnly>

<FbInternalOnly>

```
fbclone fbsource
cd ~/fbsource/xplat/sonar/desktop
yarn
yarn start
```

Tip: start with `yarn start --fast-refresh` for experimental fast refresh.

Tip: start wih `yarn start --public-build` to preview changes for public builds.

Run `code-fb .` in the same directory to open an IDE to hack on Flipper.

### Startup options

You can use several options to customise development build instance. They can be provided as command-line args or environment variables.
You can check all of them by executing `yarn start --help`:
```
yarn start [args]

Options:
  --embedded-plugins    Enables embedding of plugins into Flipper bundle. If it
                        disabled then only installed plugins are loaded. The
                        flag is enabled by default. Env var
                        FLIPPER_NO_EMBEDDED_PLUGINS is equivalent to the
                        command-line option "--no-embedded-plugins".   [boolean]
  --fast-refresh        Enable Fast Refresh - quick reload of UI component
                        changes without restarting Flipper. The flag is disabled
                        by default. Env var FLIPPER_FAST_REFRESH is equivalent
                        to the command-line option "--fast-refresh".   [boolean]
  --plugin-auto-update  [FB-internal only] Enable plugin auto-updates. The flag
                        is disabled by default in dev mode. Env var
                        FLIPPER_NO_PLUGIN_AUTO_UPDATE is equivalent to the
                        command-line option "--no-plugin-auto-update"  [boolean]
  --enabled-plugins     Load only specified plugins and skip loading rest. This
                        is useful when you are developing only one or few
                        plugins. Plugins to load can be specified as a
                        comma-separated list with either plugin id or name used
                        as identifier, e.g. "--enabled-plugins
                        network,inspector". The flag is not provided by default
                        which means that all plugins loaded.             [array]
  --open-dev-tools      Open Dev Tools window on startup. The flag is disabled
                        by default. Env var FLIPPER_OPEN_DEV_TOOLS is equivalent
                        to the command-line option "--open-dev-tools". If 
                        "FLIPPER_UPDATE_DEV_TOOLS=true" is set additionally, 
                        Flipper will try to update the dev tools from the play 
                        store.                                         [boolean]
  --dev-server-port     Dev server port. 3000 by default. Env var "PORT=3001" is
                        equivalent to the command-line option "--dev-server-port
                        3001".                          [number] [default: 3000]
  --version             Show version number                            [boolean]
  --help                Show help                                      [boolean]
```

You can also create file `.env` in `desktop` subfolder and specify any environment variables to load them automatically on `yarn start` so you don't need to pass command-line args every time, e.g.:

```
FLIPPER_FAST_REFRESH=true
FLIPPER_OPEN_DEV_TOOLS=true
FLIPPER_ENABLED_PLUGINS=flipper-messages,network,inspector
```

To start Flipper against a specific OnDemand instance, set FB_ONDEMAND flag, e.g: `FB_ONDEMAND=34435.od yarn start`

## Guidelines for writing TypeScript
* **Important:** Use `.tsx` file extension for all TypeScript files (instead of `.ts`)
* Prefer `type` for React props and state over interfaces
* Don’t prefix interfaces with `I`
* Enums, Types and Interfaces use PascalCase (uppercase first letter)
* Install 3rd party type definitions as dev dependency (e.g. `yarn add @types/lodash --dev`)

## Submitting a diff / PR

Make sure your new functionality is covered with tests, and run `yarn test` or `yarn test --watch` in the `desktop/` directory to verify that they pass. 

See the [testing](testing) page for more details on writing and running test.

To make sure you don't get any lint/formatting errors, run `yarn lint` before submitting your diff. Some errors (especially formatting errors can be auto-fixed by running `yarn fix`
