This page contains information that will help you make contributions to the Flipper codebase.

## Changelog Entries

A changelog dialog is displayed when a new version of Flipper is started for the first time. It can also be seen by clicking on the button next to the version number in the 'Welcome' screen.

<img alt="The changelog dialog in Flipper" src={useBaseUrl("img/changelog.png")} />

The content is automatically generated during the release process. You should always include a changelog entry if there is a user-visible change in your commit.

To contribute a message, include a note in the body of your commit like in example below.

:::note
Unlike other blocks that Phabricator expects (such as 'Summary' and 'Test Plan'), the changelog can only be a single line. The spelling is not case-sensitive.
:::

```bash
[layout] Add Unicorn support

Summary:
Finally, the moment we've all been waiting for: Unicorn support!

Changelog: Unicorns can be inspected in the Layout Plugin

Test Plan:
...
```

<FbInternalOnly>

For internal-only changes, prefix your line with `Facebook Changelog:`.

Entries made this way will only show up in internal builds.

### Implementation

You can find the code for the changelog generation in [desktop/scripts/generate-changelog.js](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/main/desktop/scripts/generate-changelog.js).
