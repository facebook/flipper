In this tutorial, we show you how how easy it is to build a Flipper plugin
for Android and iOS that extracts data from your native application and
displays it in the desktop app.

We then guide you through the process of converting a basic table plugin into
a full plugin with custom UI components.

Before we get started, let's define two terms we will use frequently throughout
this tutorial:

- **Desktop app**: This is the Electron-based application you run on your desktop.
- **Mobile client**: This is the mobile app running most likely on a phone or other mobile device. It connects to the desktop app.
