This tutorial requires a browser that supports [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).

## Step 1. Install Flipper JavaScript SDK

Add Flipper client to your web application. Run `npm install js-flipper` (`yarn add js-flipper`)

## Step 2. Start Flipper client

<div class="warning">

Do not start Flipper client in production! Preferably, do not even include Flipper in your production builds!

</div>

```tsx file=js/react-flipper-example/src/FlipperTicTacToe.tsx start=DOCS_START_CLIENT_START end=DOCS_START_CLIENT_END
```

## Step 3. Call `addPlugin` to add your plugin

To register a new plugin with Flipper call `flipperClient.addPlugin` and pass your plugin as an object. Your plugin must conform to the following interface:

```ts file=js/js-flipper/src/plugin.ts start=DOCS_FLIPPER_PLUGIN_START end=DOCS_FLIPPER_PLUGIN_END
```

These `onConnect` and `onDisconnect` events are triggered every time the plugin becomes (in)active in the Flipper desktop application.
If the plugin is a <Link to={useBaseUrl("/docs/extending/create-plugin#background-plugins")}>background plugin</Link>, these events are triggered typically only once (they might be triggered never, if the Desktop user didn't enable the plugin, or multiple times if they enabled or disabled the plugin a few times).

The `onConnect` callback receive a `connection` which can be used to communicate with the backend:

```tsx file=js/react-flipper-example/src/FlipperTicTacToe.tsx start=DOCS_ADD_PLUGIN_START end=DOCS_ADD_PLUGIN_END
```

You might want to store the connection somewhere to be able to send more events as long as `onDisconnect` event hasn't been fired.

The `connection` object can also be used to listen to messages coming from the Desktop plugin. See <Link to={useBaseUrl("/docs/extending/create-plugin")}>Client Plugin API</Link> for details.

## Live demo

An example plugin to play a little Tic-Tac-Toe between the Flipper Desktop and a React app can be found inside this repository as well (run `yarn && yarn start` in `js/react-flipper-example` to start the test project):

 * The React plugin implementation: [FlipperTicTacToe.tsx](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/js/react-flipper-example/src/FlipperTicTacToe.tsx)
 * The Flipper Desktop plugin implementation: [rn-tic-tac-toe/index.tsx](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/main/desktop/plugins/public/rn-tic-tac-toe/index.tsx)
