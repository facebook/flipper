Flipper provides this feature to allow distribution of `private` plugins, which are not published to [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com).

### Plugin discovery

Plugins which are supported by currently connected app/device, will be listed under "Detected in app" section in sidebar.
This significantly help users to discover useful plugins for their app.

### Plugin auto-update
Once plugin is installed, it will also keep updating to latest version.

### Setup server

Instead of hosting plugins on npm server, we need to provide custom server, which will provide a list of internal plugins.

> It is recommended to connect this server with internal package registry (to allow providing latest version).

Here is a example implementation of server using Verdaccio as package registry: [marketplace-server-example](https://github.com/usrbowe/flipper-marketplace-server).


### Enable marketplace

Open Flipper settings and enter the URL to your Flipper marketplace server. It is also adviced to toggle ON the `Enable auto update`.
