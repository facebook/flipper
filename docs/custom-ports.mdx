## FLIPPER ports (mobile apps that support certificate exchange)

By default Flipper runs its servers on ports 9088 and 9089, and the mobile SDKs look for servers on those ports.

Each of these can be overridden by setting an environment variable, with the format `${INSECURE_PORT},${SECURE_PORT}`.

To run the desktop app using custom ports:

```
env FLIPPER_PORTS=1111,2222 ./flipper
```

or with a dev build:

```
env FLIPPER_PORTS=1111,2222 yarn start
```

To configure the Android SDK for custom ports, set the `flipper.ports` prop to your chosen ports `1111,2222` like so, and then launch the Android app:

```
adb shell su 0 setprop flipper.ports 1111,2222
```

To configure the iOS SDK for custom ports, set the FLIPPER_PORTS environment variable in your app launch script or set it system-wide through User Defaults:

```
xcrun simctl spawn booted defaults write "Apple Global Domain" "com.facebook.flipper.ports" -string "1111,2222"
```

## FLIPPER ports (apps that do not support certificate exchange)

Flipper listens on 8333 for insecure (browser, Node.js) connections.

To run the desktop app using custom ports:

```
env FLIPPER_BROWSER_PORT=1111 ./flipper
```

or with a dev build:

```
env FLIPPER_BROWSER_PORT=1111 yarn start
```

To connect to Flipper on a different port from [js-flipper](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/js/js-flipper), you need to override its `urlBase` when you [start it](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/0993d21f3b52d38969e4d2e330eb97ec4d840a9d/js/react-flipper-example/src/FlipperTicTacToe.tsx#L19).

```ts
flipperClient.start('React Tic-Tac-Toe', { urlBase: 'localhost:1111' });
```

## METRO SERVER PORTS

You can also setup Flipper to use a different Metro Server port (default=8081) using this environement variable:

```
METRO_SERVER_PORT=3333 ./flipper
```

## ADB REVERSE PROXY PORTS

And setup a different ADB port used for reverse proxying when plugged through USB (default=5037) using:

```
ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT=4444 ./flipper
```
