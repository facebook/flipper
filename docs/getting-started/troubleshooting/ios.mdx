Flipper is a 'work in progress' and issues may occur. This page contains known issues associated with the iOS platform and provides steps you can take to try to resolve them.

## In-app diagnostics

You'll need to manually add this [ViewController](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/main/iOS/FlipperKit/FlipperDiagnosticsViewController.m) to your app to see the in-app diagnostics.

## iOS device not showing up

Make sure [idb](https://fbidb.io/docs/installation) is installed and configured in the Flipper settings.

## iOS simulator device not showing up

Ensure that your simulator is on the same version as selected in `xcode-select`. You can do that by checking that commands `ps aux | grep CoreSimulator` and `xcode-select -p` shows the same Xcode version. If not, update the xcode version by sudo `xcode-select --switch <Path to xcode>`

## iOS app connection error "Connection failed. Failed to find device..."

If during connecting iOS app to Flipper you see error message "Connection failed. Failed to find device <device_id> while trying to connect app" - try executing `idb kill` on a terminal and restarting Flipper as workaround to reset idb state.
