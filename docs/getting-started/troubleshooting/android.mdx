Flipper is a 'work in progress' and issues may occur. This page contains known issues associated with the Android platform and provides steps you can take to try to resolve them.

## In-app diagnostics
The Flipper SDK includes an in-app connection diagnostics screen to help you diagnose problems.

Replace `<APP_PACKAGE>` below with the package name of your app, for example, such as `com.facebook.flipper.sample`.

On a terminal, run the following:

```bash
adb shell am start -n <APP_PACKAGE>/com.facebook.flipper.android.diagnostics.FlipperDiagnosticActivity
```

This will only work if you added `FlipperDiagnosticActivity` to your `AndroidManifest.xml`. See [getting started](../android-native.mdx#diagnostics) for help.

## Exception from call site #4 bootstrap method

Build error after including the Flipper dependency:

```
Exception from call site #4 bootstrap method
```

This can happen because we include [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4597#issuecomment-461204144) as dependency which makes use of Java 8 features. There are two ways of dealing with this:

**Enable Java 8 support**

Add this to your Gradle config:

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    targetCompatibility = "8"
    sourceCompatibility = "8"
   }
 }
 ```

 **Exclude the OkHttp3 dependency**

 Alternatively, if you don't plan on making use of OkHttp, you can exclude the dependency from the build entirely:

 ```
debugImplementation('com.facebook.flipper:flipper:*') {
  exclude group: 'com.squareup.okhttp3'
}
```

## Duplicate class `com.facebook.jni.*`

This can occur when mixing different versions of [FBJNI](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fbjni), a library we use to interact with native C++ code.

Speficially, this can happen when the versions `0.0.x` and `0.1.x` are mixed. Version `0.1.0` of FBJNI switched to using [Google Prefab](https://google.github.io/prefab/) for distributing native artifacts, which made the split into combined, "java-only" and "header" packages redundant and only requires a single dependency in your projects.

When including both "fbjni-java-only:0.0.1" and "fbjni:0.1.0" in one project, you will now duplicate class errors during the build process. You must ensure that only one of the two versions is used in your entire dependency tree. Start by looking at `./gradlew :myapp:dependencies` to see where the different version requirements come from. Then exclude the FBJNI dependency from one of them, as follows:

```groovy
implementation("com.facebook.react:react-native:+") {
    exclude group:'com.facebook.fbjni'
}
```
