Starting with React Native 0.62, after generating your project with `react-native init`, the Flipper integration is ready out of the box for debug builds:

* For Android, start the Flipper Desktop application, and start your project using `yarn android`. Your application will appear in Flipper.
* For iOS, run `pod install` once in the `ios` directory of your project. After that, run `yarn ios` and start Flipper. Your application will show up in Flipper.

By default, the following plugins will be available:

* Layout Inspector
* Network
* Databases
* Images
* Shared Preferences
* Crash Reporter
* React DevTools
* Metro Logs

Additional plugins can be installed through the plugin manager.

### Using the latest Flipper SDK

By default React Native might ship with an outdated Flipper SDK. To make sure you are using the latest version, determine the latest released version of Flipper by running `npm info flipper`.

Android:

1. Bump the `FLIPPER_VERSION` variable in `android/gradle.properties`, for example: `FLIPPER_VERSION=0.127.0`.
2. Run `./gradlew clean` in the `android` directory.

iOS:

1. Call `use_flipper` with a specific version in `ios/Podfile`, for example: `use_flipper!({ 'Flipper' => '0.127.0' })`.
2. Run `pod install --repo-update` in the `ios` directory.

## Manual Setup
