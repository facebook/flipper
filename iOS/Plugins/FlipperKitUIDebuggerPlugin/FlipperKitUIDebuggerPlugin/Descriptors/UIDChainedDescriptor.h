/**
   A chained descriptor is a special type of descriptor that models the
   inheritance hierarchy in native UI frameworks. With this setup you can define
   a descriptor for each class in the inheritance chain and given that we record
   the super class's descriptor we can automatically aggregate the results for
   each descriptor in the inheritance hierarchy in a chain.

   The result is that each descriptor in the inheritance chain only exports the
   attributes that it knows about but we still get all the attributes from the
   parent classes.
