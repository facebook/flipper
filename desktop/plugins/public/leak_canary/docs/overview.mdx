The LeakCanary plugin provides Developers with Flipper support for [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary), an open source memory leak detection library.

Leaks detected by LeakCanary appear automatically in Flipper. Each leak displays a hierarchy of objects, beginning with the garbage collector root and ending at the leaked class.
Selecting any object in this list displays contents of the object's various fields.
