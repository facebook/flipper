The Navigation Plugin enables users to quickly navigate to deep links within their mobile applications to help speed up the development cycle. The plugin is designed to integrate easily within your existing navigation framework or as a standalone tool.

Users can bookmark deep links and jump to them via the button in the tool bar, as shown in the following screenshot.

Navigation events within the app can also be logged to Flipper, which enables the user to view past navigation events and jump straight to them (see the following screenshot) or export the navigation events for reporting.
