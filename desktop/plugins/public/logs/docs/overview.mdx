The Logs plugin shows device logs without any additional setup. This is a device plugin, which means it's not tied to any specific app and there is no additional setup needed to see the logs.

The following screenshot shows an example of a device log obtained via the Logs plugin.

## Plugin functionality

### Filtering

The search bar can be used to search for logs and act as a filter for certain types.

From the context menu on the table headers, you can show additional information, such as timestamp, PID or TID.

Clicking on a tag, PID or TID in the table filters only for logs with the same value.

### Expression Watcher

The Expression Watcher in the sidebar can be used to 'watch' for certain logs to happen and count how often they occur. An expression can be a simple string, or a regular expression, matched against the logs.

When the notify checkbox is enabled, Flipper sends notifications once the log is being processed. This lets you know when the 'watcher' triggered, even if Flipper is in the background.
