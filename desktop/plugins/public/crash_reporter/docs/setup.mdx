You don't have to instantiate the <Link to={useBaseUrl("/docs/features/plugins/crash-reporter")}>Crash Reporter plugin</Link> in your app in order to use its basic functionality.

You can use the Crash Reporter plugin to send notifications for exceptions that are suppressed in your Android application.
You could even use it to send notifications when the [Litho Error Boundary](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/staticdocs/litho/docs/mainconcepts/use-error-boundary/) is triggered.

In order to send custom notifications, take the steps detailed below.

## Android

1. Instantiate and add the plugin in `FlipperClient`.

```java
import com.facebook.flipper.plugins.crashreporter.CrashReporterPlugin;

client.addPlugin(CrashReporterPlugin.getInstance());
```

2. Use the following API to trigger your custom crash notification.

```java
import com.facebook.flipper.plugins.crashreporter.CrashReporterPlugin;

CrashReporterPlugin.getInstance().sendExceptionMessage(Thread.currentThread(), error);
```
