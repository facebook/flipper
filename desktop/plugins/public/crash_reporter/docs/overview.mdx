The Crash Reporter plugin shows a notification in Flipper whenever an app crashes. You can click on the notification to see crash information such as stacktrace and other metadata.

For Android, clicking on the 'Open in Logs' button jumps to the relevant row in the Logs plugin containing the crash information, as shown in the following screenshots.
