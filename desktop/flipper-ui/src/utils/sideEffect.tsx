/**
 * Registers a sideEffect for the given redux store. Use this utility rather than subscribing to the Redux store directly, which fixes a few problems:
 * 1. It decouples and throttles the effect so that no arbitrary expensive burden is added to every store update.
 * 2. It makes sure that a crashing side effect doesn't crash the entire store update.
 * 3. It helps with tracing and monitoring perf problems.
 * 4. It puts the side effect behind a selector so that the side effect is only triggered if a relevant part of the store changes, like we do for components.
 *
 * @param store
 * @param options
 * @param selector
